                    This API will be the main datasource for CovA providing selected data already formatted and bundled - ready to use.
                    Some features will be server-side statistical analysis of potentially interesting data combinations or an integrated JavaScript Sandbox
                    to learn young and old how to interpret data with state of the art web languages.

                    To properly run both the API and the other consumed interfaces CovA needs to support all sorts of satellite data. Therefore it might be
                    necessary to write small interpreter modules server side.

                    At some point we would like to be able to integrate a JavaScript Sandbox for playing around with sample data from our own APi but also relevant data from third parties.

                    Besides being able to play around with all sorts of data on CovA users should at some point be able to create an account, preferably with
                    third-party options. This feature would enable even more features we can not think of yet. Please be patient :-)

                    because I wanted to start coming up with an idea on 30.05 and thus had less time actually fixing and developing the application. <br>
                    Some basic functionalities are already available and give you an insight on how much fun CovA could be in the future.

                From idea, to concept to paper (not literally) - CovA was completely developed in 48 hours from 30.05.2020 to 31.05.2020. We are looking forward
                to the next SpaceApps Challenge!
